Description: For a data matrix with m rows and n columns (m>=n), the power
	     method is used to compute, simultaneously, the eigendecomposition
	     of a square symmetric matrix. This result is used to obtain the
	     singular value decomposition (SVD) and the principal component
             analysis (PCA) results. Compared to the classical SVD method,
	     the first r singular values can be computed.
